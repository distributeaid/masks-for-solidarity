title: About the masks
---

> Our face masks are **durable**, **washable**, and **reusable**. They were made
> to withstand the extremes of a refugee camp environment so we're sure they'll
> hold up just about anywhere.

The masks are most similar in style to hand-crafted cotton facemasks, but the
material they are made from leaves fewer gaps for particles to pass through. You
can read more about the science behind them at the end of this section.

## When to use them:

- Everyday use: walking around town, on public transit, in shops, at socially
  distant gatherings, and at work. These masks are particularly well suited for
  many essential jobs such as delivering food or attending a checkout lane at
  the grocery store.
- For aid workers in situations with limited contact, such as socially distanced
  planning meetings, cooking/preparing supplies, and during distributions.
- Distributing masks to the community. Our masks are cheaper and more
  environmentally friendly to distribute than single-use surgical masks. Most
  importantly, they meet the ongoing need for masks.
- As a "best alternative" to proper PPE when absolutely necessary.

## When _not_ to use them:

- For medical professionals, as replacements to medical-grade masks such as
  N95s.
- For any job that puts you in close contact with strangers for over 15 minutes,
  especially if the stranger(s) may or may not be wearing a mask, or if you're
  in a confined environment which prevents social distancing. Based on what we
  know of COVID-19, this is a higher risk environment and your workplace should
  supply you with appropriate PPE.

## The science

The masks are made with a 70mm non-woven fabric that meets certain EU and U.S.
environmental and consumer-safety standards. The non-woven spun-bound fabric is
produced from
[polypropylene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polypropylene#Clothing) and
contains a [UV stabilizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer_stabilizers).
The fabric itself passed the
[OEKO-TEX Standard 100](https://www.oeko-tex.com/en/our-standards/standard-100-by-oeko-tex)
inspection for product class 1, which tests around 100 parameters to prove that
it's safe for human contact. Passing inspection also means that the fabric meets
or exceeds international standards, including the requirements of Annex XVII of
REACH in the EU (the use of azo-dyes, nickel, etc), as well as CPSIA regulating
the total content of lead in children's articles in the USA. You can check the
fabric used for our masks by entering the label number `11-33771`
