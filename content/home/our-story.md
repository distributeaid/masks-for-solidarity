> When women in the Moria refugee camp first heard about COVID-19, they knew
> they couldn't wait for Greece or the EU to act. Working out of Team Humanityâ€™s
> Hope & Peace Center, they designed and produced face masks to protect
> themselves and their neighbours.

Their operation was so successful that they started supporting fellow asylum
seekers in camps across Europe.

In June 2020, when protests broke out across the U.S. in support of Black Lives
Matter, they started looking at what they could do to show solidarity with
others who are impacted by the effects of racism in our global society. An
initial batch of 10,000 masks were sent and distributed among organizations
operating across the United States, including homeless shelters, food banks,
indigenous reservations, medical facilities on the southern border, and women's
shelters, and the idea for Masks for Humanity was born.

> Now these makers want to protect the world. Our starting goal is to fund,
> make, and distribute 100,000 masks to people in need around the world by
> October 1st.
