Masks For Humanity is looking to support community / grassroots organizations,
Indigenous peoples, and medical professionals working at under-resourced
facilities. Eligible organizations can purchase masks at-cost (meaning you only
pay exactly as much as it costs to make the masks), or apply to receive masks
for free by completing the forms below.

> At-cost... for free... Why not both! You can always purchase some masks
> at-cost now AND sign up for our needs assessment to receive free masks later.

## Buy Masks At-Cost

Masks are available for
$1.50 each, which includes shipping all the way to you. There is a minimum order of 1,000 masks ($1,500)
to keep this manageable for our volunteers.

To apply, fill out this
[form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1L0zxV-8WCfeuAGJBrabZAaMtYfXXWuLREkyD-gJTAz8/edit?usp=sharing).

Can't meet the minimum? Get your community involved and go in on an order with
other local organizations!

## Get Masks For Free

Please complete [this form](https://forms.gle/AbV6vFf6pPA2gf9b9) to be included
in our needs assessment! If your group or organization is eligible, our team
will follow up via email when masks become available. Allocations are made on a
weekly basis. We hope that you understand why we cannot guarantee if you will
receive free masks, how many you'll receive, and how long they will take to get
to you.

There is no minimum or maximum request, though we do encourage you to ask for
1 - 3 months worth of masks. If you have funding, please consider purchasing
masks at-cost so that we may reserve our free masks for groups with no
alternatives.
